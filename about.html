            <h3> History</h3>
                <p>With an aim to provide meaningful assistance to our alma mater in Georgetown, Guyana, five graduates from St. Joseph&rsquo;s High School got together on October 15, 1994 in a Brooklyn apartment on Farragut Road, near the junction of Flatbush and Rogers Avenues and established this St. Joseph High School Alumni Association, U.S. Chapter. The five pioneering young ladies were Sandra Hunte-Gomes (who is sadly no longer with us), Beverley Richmond-Crane, Fay Fraser, Judith Richmond, and I - Lorna Campbell. The initiative was the brainchild of the late Sandra Gomes.</p>
                <p>During the three months that followed, the founders set about reaching out to fellow alumni through letters, telephone contact and the good old word-of-mouth. On January 14, 1995, the first general meeting was held, and we were joined by Gweneth Blair, Angela Fox, Kim Grant, Shelley Humphrey, Rubina Lashley, Goldwyn Dolsy Lewis-Wilkinson, Averil Sumner, Desiree Telford-Oginga. At this meeting, among some of the key decisions made were the institution of membership dues at $25 per year, opening of a bank account, and holding membership meetings on the second Saturday of every month.</p>
                <p>On May 13, 1995, the first election for office bearers was held, and the positions were filled as follows:</p>
                <p>President: Sandra Gomes</p>
                <p>Vice-President: Maude Ann Rodrigues</p>
                <p>General Secretary: Lorna Campbell</p>
                <p>Treasurer: Angela Fox</p>
                <p>Asst. Secretary/Treasurer: Kim Grant</p>
                <p>Committee Members: Judy Agard, Gweneth Blair, Jocelyn Bryant-Rodney, Beverley Cave, Fay Fraser, Jacquelene Lashley-James, and Beverley Richmond-Crane.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1995, Sandra Gomes and I paid a visit to St. Joseph High School. We received a warm welcome from then headmistress, Mrs. Joan Kendall, and were later treated to a tour of the premises by Mrs. Sandra King. The needs of the school were quite evident and abundant. Since then, through the hard work of a small group of dedicated members and the love and generosity of numerous supporters and friends, we have managed to provide huge assistance to our alma mater in helping to foster its renowned legacy of excellence in education and social values.&nbsp;Over the years, we have made immense contributions to refurbish the electrical and plumbing systems, the northern fence, Home Economics Lab and general conditions at the school. We were part of the initiative that saw the introduction of computers at SJHS &ndash; in the secretarial office and the establishment of its first Information Technology Lab.</p>
